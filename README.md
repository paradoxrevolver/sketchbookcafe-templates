# sketchbookcafe-templates
Templates that I've created for the website sketchbook.cafe.

These files are actually intended to be pasted directly into the HTML and CSS fields for a custom template, so they won't work alone.

## starfield
A night theme with a backdrop of slowly drifting stars.

This theme uses your character's first color (in the Colors tab) as a highlight color. Pick something vibrant!

## ramune
A calm and bubbling theme reminiscent of glass marbles and Japanese soda.
